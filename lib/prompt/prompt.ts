üìù Quiz Description: {{quizDescription}}
üìö Subject: {{subject}} (e.g., Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology)
üéØ Difficulty Level: {{difficulty}} (Easy / Medium / Hard)
‚è±Ô∏è Time Limit: {{timeLimit}} (in minutes)
üé≤ Unique Seed: {{seed}}

üîç Instructions:
1. Carefully interpret the subject and description to determine quiz scope.
2. Ensure every question aligns with peer-reviewed or textbook-standard medical knowledge (e.g., Gray's Anatomy, Robbins Pathology, Guyton Physiology).
3. Every question must be fact-checked before inclusion. No ambiguous or outdated information.
4. Use only **one correct answer** and provide exactly **three distractors** per question.
5. Never include misleading or factually incorrect questions, answers, or explanations.
6. Prioritize core concepts, common clinical scenarios, and high-yield facts.
7. Create between 10 to 20 questions to match the time limit and difficulty.
8. All questions must be fresh and original‚Äîno phrasing reused from previous generations.
9. Do not include any question where the correct answer cannot be unambiguously verified using standard medical references.
10. The correct answer must be one of the 4 options listed. It must be **100% accurate**.
11. If you're unsure about a question's accuracy, discard it and generate a new one.
12. Explanations must be concise, correct, and only reference validated concepts.

üõë Accuracy Enforcement Step:
Before finalizing:
- ‚úÖ Double-check that the correct answer is factually and clinically accurate.
- ‚úÖ Ensure it is included in the options exactly as written.
- ‚úÖ Remove or correct any question with outdated or misleading information.
- üö´ Do not generate any question if the correct answer is not crystal-clear and medically sound.

üì¶ Return ONLY a valid JSON array of questions. No markdown, no comments, no extra text.

4. Ensure each question is:
   - Clear and medically accurate
   - Focused on key concepts and clinical relevance
   - Not obscure, misleading, or overly niche
5. Match the number of questions to the intended length:
   - Minimum: 10 questions
   - Maximum: 15 questions
6. Make questions **unique and original** ‚Äî do **not** reuse content from prior prompts.
7. The **correct answer must match exactly one of the listed options**.
8. Include a brief medical explanation for each correct answer (aimed at students or junior doctors).
 9.Ensure all questions are fresh, creative, and never repeated‚Äîeven if the prompt looks the same.
10. You must not reuse any phrasing or question you‚Äôve previously generated, even under similar prompts.

Final Quality Check:

Output Format:
Return ONLY a **valid JSON array** (no markdown, no commentary).

Each quiz question must follow this exact structure:

[
  {
    "question": "What is the primary artery supplying the visual cortex?",
    "options": ["Anterior cerebral artery", "Middle cerebral artery", "Posterior cerebral artery", "Basilar artery"],
    "answer": "Posterior cerebral artery",
    "explanation": "The visual cortex lies in the occipital lobe and is supplied primarily by the posterior cerebral artery."
  },
  ...
]

The goal is to deliver a well-constructed, focused quiz that follows the specific quiz prompt and adheres to professional medical education standards.`;
